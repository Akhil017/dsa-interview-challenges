### [Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

##### Approach

- Naive approach would be to check the highest profit by considering each value of the array with all the next values of the array
- A better approach would be to keep checking the profit with least value so far with the current array value and store the maximum profit so far obtained.

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let profit = 0; // start profit as 0 which is minimum possible profit even if no transactions are done
  let low = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
    // store the minimum array index in low
    if (prices[low] > prices[i]) {
      low = i;
    }

    // if the difference between current array and lowest value so far is highest, store it as profit
    if (prices[i] - prices[low] > profit) {
      profit = prices[i] - prices[low];
    }
  }

  return profit;
};
```

##### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
