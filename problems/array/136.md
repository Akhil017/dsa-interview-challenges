## [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

### Approach

- Good approach would be to store the count of each elements, and return the element having single occurence
- As the elements are only positive integers in this problems, XOR operation can be utilized. All the elements occur twice, except one; XOR between same elements will result in 0 and left one will be single non duplicated number. (order of XOR operation does not matter)

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var singleNumber = function (nums) {
  let singleNumber = 0;
  const length = nums.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    singleNumber ^= nums[i];
  }

  return singleNumber;

  // Alternatively, a single line solution
  // return nums.reduce((a, b) => a ^ b);
};
```

##### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
