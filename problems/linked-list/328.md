### [Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)

##### Approach

- A simpler approach would be to create 2 pointers; one for odd list and one for even. These can be either sentinel node or real nodes from the list. Start traversing through the list and point the current node to the odd list and next node to the even list.

```js
var oddEvenList = function(head) {
  if(head === null) return head;

  // create sentinel heads
  let oddHead = new ListNode(0, null);
  let evenHead = new ListNode(0, null);
  
  // store the base pointers
  const evenHeadBase = evenHead;
  const oddHeadBase = oddHead;

  while(head){
    oddHead.next = head;          // current node to the odd list
    evenHead.next = head.next;    // next node to the even list
    
    // move the pointers
    head = head.next?.next;
    oddHead = oddHead.next;
    evenHead = evenHead.next;
  }
  
  // connect the odd and even lists
  oddHead.next = evenHeadBase.next;

  return oddHeadBase.next;
};
```

##### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
